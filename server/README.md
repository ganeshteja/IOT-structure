The only server used in this is an MQTT server. For local application "mosca" server that runs inside node red is sufficient.
This can be installed from the " manage pallet>> install nodes ".

Instead use this to install from the terminal: npm install node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker

Here's a link to know more about Mosca:  https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-mqtt-broker 

After installing the server, it must be setup by giving a port and adding security if needed.
