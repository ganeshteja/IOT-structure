# Automation-BareBones


This is an essentials project designed to work as the basic structure of many other IOT projects. 
This includes the basic setting up and running of various components that make the network.
Raspberry pi is used to run all the servers and various espressif boards like esp01,esp12 and esp32 along with several arduino boards are used as the nodes that interact with applications.

Node-Red is the main application used on the raspberry pi since it makes complicated programming easier.Arduino IDE is used to program all the nodes (both espressif and arduino boards).

Any further developments on raspberrypi are solely implemented on Node-Red.
